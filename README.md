# Mars Rover Tech Challenge

This is my solution to the [Mars rover tech challenge](https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/).

### Requirements

Tested with Python Version 3.7 on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.4

### Installation

Download [rover.py](https://github.com/timothyhouzet/mars-rover/blob/master/rover.py) and import using: **from rover import Rover**

See [test.py](https://github.com/timothyhouzet/mars-rover/blob/master/test.py) for usage examples

## Notes

* Being set on a rectangular plateau/grid it assumed that a rover may not move past the bounds set for that rectangular plateau/grid.
* Multiple rovers can be created with the Rover class.
* Currently there is no input interface to the Rover class but one can easily be created using standard input.
